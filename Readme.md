Simple implementation of a neuronal netwok
==========================================

This is my implementation of a simple layer based neural network.
It creates feed forward networks and is trained by backpropagation using an adaptive step size.

The main function creates an example network that learns three pixels of an image and produces the perceptive map after an error threshold is reached.
