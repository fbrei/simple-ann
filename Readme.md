Simple implementation of a neuronal netwok
==========================================

This is my implementation of a simple layer based neural network.
It creates feed forward networks and is trained by backpropagation.
The main function implements some sample stuff that I use for testing and that gets moved to sample.c later in the process.

Todo List
=========

- Implement a function that generates the perceptive map of a NN
- simplify training process
- allow to save the trained NN to a file and also read from it
